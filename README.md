Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their annual income, spending score, and age. It helps businesses identify distinct customer groups and tailor marketing strategies effectively.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
File: Mall_Customers.csv
Columns:
CustomerID - Unique customer ID
Gender - Male/Female
Age - Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$) - Annual income in thousand dollars
Spending Score (1-100) - Score assigned based on spending behavior
ðŸ”‘ Key Steps
Load Dataset
Read and explore the dataset using Pandas.

Feature Selection

2D Clustering: Annual Income vs Spending Score
3D Clustering: Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score
Elbow Method
Determine optimal number of clusters by plotting WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares).

Apply K-Means
Cluster customers into groups (e.g., 5 clusters).

Visualization

2D Scatter Plot of clusters.
3D Scatter Plot for deeper insights.
Save Clustered Data
Final clustered dataset can be exported for further analysis.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (Data handling)
NumPy (Numerical operations)
Matplotlib (2D & 3D visualization)
Scikit-learn (K-Means clustering)
ðŸ“Š Results
Visualized clusters in both 2D and 3D.
Segmentation can help in targeted marketing strategies.
